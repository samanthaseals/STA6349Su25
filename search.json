    "text": "Note: this is an abbreviated syllabus. The full syllabus is available through Classmate and/or Canvas.\n\nInstructor Information\n\nDr. Samantha Seals\nOffice: 4/344\n\n\n\nMeeting Times and Location\n\nTR 2:00 pm–4:40 pm\n\n2:00 pm–3:15 pm: Lecture\n3:30 pm–4:30 pm: Daily practice\n\nPhysical classroom: 4/406\nZoom classroom: see Canvas or full syllabus for link\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\nMonday: 2:00–4:00 pm (Central)\nWednesday: 2:00–4:00 pm (Central)\nOther times by appointment\n\n\n\nGrading and Evaluation\nThe course grade will be determined as follows:\n\nDaily practice (25%): Each lecture day, students will complete an activity using Quarto and R. The resulting .html file should be submitted to the designated dropbox on Canvas by 11:59 pm on the specified date (see Canvas).\nAssignments (25%): Every module will finish with an assignment to demonstrate the knowledge gained. These will be like the daily practice, but putting together. The resulting .html file should be submitted to the designated dropbox on Canvas by 11:59 pm on the specified date (see Canvas).\nProjects (25%): There are two group projects in this course. The first project will result in a recorded presentation while the second project will result in a live presentation. Students are required to attend class during live presentations on July 31, 2025.\nFinal Exam (25%): The final exam will be a timed, concepts-based exam. While there may be some calculations needed, you will not be processing raw data. The final exam will be on Canvas on August 7, 2025. All students will have 3 hours to complete the exam.\n\n\n\nLate Policy\nAssigments have due dates, however, the dropboxes will not close until the end of the semester. All students are automatically granted “extensions” without question.\nNote that if there is not a submission when I go to grade (after the initial deadline), I will assign a zero (0) and request that you submit the assignment when you are able to. This is only for record keeping purposes. There is no penalty for submitting late and a full grade will be given upon review of your submission.\nExtensions are not available for daily practices, projects, or the final exam."
